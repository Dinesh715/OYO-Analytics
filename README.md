## 📌 Project Summary

This dashboard was designed to analyze hotel KPIs across multiple properties and booking platforms. It helps stakeholders answer important questions like:

- How much revenue are we generating and where is it coming from?
- Which booking platforms bring in high-value customers?
- What’s the occupancy rate, and how does it differ across weekdays vs. weekends?
- Which properties are overachieving, and which ones need a guest relations hug?
